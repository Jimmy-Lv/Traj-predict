1.Useful. add some detailed background about trajectory prediction in the first section. mention that the application is used to predict the destination of a running taxi.
 

2.CNN. add some description about CNN in the prelimiliar section. add more description. 


3.Image vs seq. strenthen that the difference between the sequence and images. one dimensional sequence is not good for capturing some local structure, trend, density. and also multi-scale. one dimensional -> two dimensional 

add the sequence in the Fig.1 to descibe the difference.

section 'multi-scale' -> traditional one-dimensional sequence analysis
donot to focus on the different patterns of the trajectory, we should focus on the one-dimention to two dimensional problem.



4.Model detail. some formula about the visulization deconvlution.

5. Discussion about the local model and global model. and discuss why localmodel is more efficient to capture the patterns.


6. Sensibility of parameters. The changing the basic structure does not violate the whole structure. the grid size
